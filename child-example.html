    <style>
      .parent > p {
        color: red;
      }

      /* In this example:

We have a <div> element with the class "parent". Inside this parent, we have several <p> elements (paragraphs), which are the "children".
The CSS file contains a child selector .parent > p. This selector targets all <p> elements that are direct children of an element with the class "parent".
The style rule inside the child selector (color: red;) will apply only to the <p> elements that are direct children of .parent, making their text color red.
Note that the <div> element inside the parent is not affected by this rule since it's not a <p> element.
This setup will result in the text of the <p> elements turning red, while the text inside the <div> will remain unaffected, demonstrating how the child selector specifically targets direct children of a specified element. */
